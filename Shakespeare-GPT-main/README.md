# Shakespeare-GPT

## Overview

Shakespeare-GPT is a Python-based project that trains a simple generative model on the text of the plays and writings of William Shakespeare. It leverages a character-level language modelling approach to learn to generate Shakespeare-style text.

The repository contains:

* tinyShakespeare.txt — a text corpus drawn from Shakespeare’s works.

* shakespeare_gpt.py — the main script implementing the training / inference logic.

* generated.txt — some example output produced by the model.

## Purpose

The aim of this project is:

* To illustrate how a simple transformer-style model can be trained on a classic text corpus.

* To explore the capability of a neural language model to mimic Shakespearean style given a modest dataset and modest model size.

* To provide an educational example of language modelling, text generation, and the practical challenges of training such models (e.g., dataset preparation, overfitting, sampling strategies).
